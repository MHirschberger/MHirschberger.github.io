Sass (Syntactically awesome style sheets) is a CSS extension language that acts as a preprocessor scripting language in which code is interpreted or compiled into CSS. Preprocessors like Sass make large, complex CSS files more manageable by allowing the use of variables, nesting, and inheritance principles. 

When you are finished styling a web page using Sass, the preprocessed Sass file is saved as a normal CSS file which the webpage can then use. In order to use Sass, it must be installed on your computer. A Sass file can then be compiled into CSS with the `sass` command, the location of the Sass file to compile, and the location of where the CSS should be outputted. 

Like a programming language, Sass makes use of variables, that store information to be reused throughout the stylesheet. Examples of information that can be stored in Sass include colors and fonts, among other attributes.
