Python was the first language I learned when I taught myself programming. Being very similar to Python, Ruby was quite pleasant to learn and was a great second language to learn as I worked through the Flatiron curriculum. While very similar to each other compared to other programming languages, Ruby and Python have some major differences between them as well. This post will analyze both the similarities and differences between the two languages. 

## Similarities

Python and Ruby share many similarities. They are both dynamically-typed, meaning that variables do not have types and existing variables can change type. This is because the data type is only checked at runtime. These two languages are also interpreted languages, meaning that programs are not compiled before they are executed. Instead, they are executed directly in the interpreter where they are written.
