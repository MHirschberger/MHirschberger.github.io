Since graduating from Flatiron School, I have been trying to keep my skills sharp. One of the ways has been learning new technologies. To that end, I've started learning Node.js, using Javascript on the backend. It is my hope that learning Node will help to further build out my knowledge and skillset in full stack web development.
