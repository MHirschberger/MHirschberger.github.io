Whew! After 13 months, it is hard to believe my time at Flatiron School is winding down. I just submitted my React final project and passing the assessment, I will be finished with the course. Looking back, I am amazed at the journey and how far I've come. 

As I finished the final project I became aware of how my confidence in my coding abilities has grown over the course of the program. As I finish, I eagerly await the job search and look forward to continuing to build my skillset. In addition to the job search activities, some of the major things I plan on working on after graduation include:
* Building out functionality on my React project and deploying it via Heroku.
* Refining my other four Flatiron School projects.
* Practicing algorithms and data structures in preparation for technical job interviews.

Can't wait to get started!
