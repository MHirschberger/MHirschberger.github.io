Since graduating from Flatiron School, I have been trying to keep my skills sharp. One of the ways has been learning new technologies. To that end, I've started learning Node.js, using Javascript on the backend. It is my hope that learning Node will help to further build out my knowledge and skillset in full stack web development.

Through tutorials and online courses, I have so far learned about creating a Node server from scratch, including sending request, receiving and parsing through responses, and the Node lifecycle and Event loop. Some other topics I plan to cover include NoSQL, MongoDB, an in-depth study of APIs including REST APIs and GraphQL. With my study of React and Redux in Flatiron School, it is my hope to become fully skilled in the MERN stack.
