## Introduction

Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, comprise any database that does not follow the relational database model. Having been created to handle Big Data demands, NoSQL databases have steadily risen in popularity over recent years. NoSQL databases tend to be more flexable and scalable than relational databases and thus are better apt to handle the fast-growing and fast-moving nature of Big Data. Both types of databases, however, have their pros and cons. 

## Differences between Relational and Non-relational databases

There are several ways which distinguish relational and NoSQL databases. One way is that NoSQL databases do not require predefined schema; schema design is more flexible. Second, NoSQL databases can handle data that is not structured, unlike relational databases which required data to be organized into rows and columns. This makes relational databases preferable for heavy querying. However, non-relational databases can often handle other types of data like JSON objects. This makes it easier to use for web applications and for use with object-oriented programming languages. One of the most popular NoSQL databases is MongoDB, used in the popular MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).
