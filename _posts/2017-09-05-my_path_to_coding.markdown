My interest in coding had been simmering on the back burner for awhile. I went to engineering school in New York City and had many friends who were computer engineering students (I studied civil engineering). During these college years, I would many a time hear these friends converse about the technicalities of C++, Java, or MATLAB, to name a few topics, and was impressed by the projects that they created. Many of them went off to companies in NYC or the West Coast to begin their tech careers. I was intrigued. I had some exposure in programming, such as solving some engineering problems using Python and performing some basic statistical analysis using MATLAB, but nothing involving software development. 

Having graduated from college and working for the past year, I've had the opportunity to explore coding in my spare time using some of the free resources available online. My intrigue began turning into a steadily growing passion. I have grown to love the creativity and intense problem solving that coding requires, especially the process of breaking down a complex problem into simpler more manageable components. Another exciting aspect of coding is the abstract thinking that is involved. While in my current engineering role, most problem solving has revolved around the physical, built environment, coding intrinsically seems to involve more pronounced logic and seems more akin to solving puzzles. The idea of performing this type of work on a day-to-day basis to develop software that other people and organizations will utilize excites me greatly. I now start a new chapter in my path to coding by beginning the Flatiron School's Online Web Developer Program and I could not be more excited for the journey ahead.
